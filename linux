ping - The ping command is used to test the network connectivity between our computer and another device or server. 
       It sends ICMP echo request packets to the target host and waits for a response. If the host is reachable, it replies, and ping displays the response time. 
       This helps diagnose network issues and check if a host is online and how long it takes for data to travel to and from that host.
